# My MacBook M1 Dev Setup

I was searching for new laptop from last 2 months, for windows laptop. But then I found Apple's Silicon Macs. After seeing MacBook with Apple's Silicon Chip Specifications i fall in love with it. If it was still intel in MacBook i would have never bought it. But i rushed to Apple India Website and placed order. I bought a base-level 13" MacBook Air (M1 chip, 8Gb RAM, and 256Gb SSD). I was very excited about the potential speed increases that I could get from a small development laptop. Most of all, I love that it runs 100% silent with FanLess design.

Overall this computer has been incredible.
