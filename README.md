# My MacBook M1 Dev Setup

I was searching for new laptop from last 2 months, for windows laptop. But then I found Apple's Silicon Macs. After seeing MacBook with Apple's Silicon Chip Specifications i fall in love with it. If it was still intel in MacBook i would have never bought it. But i rushed to Apple India Website and placed order. I bought a base-level 13" MacBook Air (M1 chip, 8Gb RAM, and 256Gb SSD). I was very excited about the potential speed increases that I could get from a small development laptop. Most of all, I love that it runs 100% silent with FanLess design.

Overall this computer has been incredible.

    ## Introduction to use this guide

    I made this manual to effectively see the status of different apparatuses for the new Apple Silicon Mac. I expect this to be a living archive, that gets refreshed as things change.

    The objective is to disclose the most ideal approach to introduce or utilize these instruments and which apparatuses you can trust. Toward the beginning of each part, I have made the elites of each tool inside that category group.
